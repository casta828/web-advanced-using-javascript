# Assignment 2

### Instructions
Using only JavaScript without any external libraries (that is, no jQuery, etc), you are to implement three separate interactions that are commonly included in web sites: a modal, a drop-down menu, and a side tray. All three should be implemented in the same page, and each of the interactions should transition smoothly over the course of 500 milliseconds (half a second) between pre- and post-triggered states. You may use any transition function youâ€™d like.
